        "In this semester's lab on reinforcement learning, we will be using the [Frozen Lake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment. The Frozen Lake environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem commonly used for teaching and experimenting with RL algorithms. It is part of the [OpenAI Gym library](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and is modeled after the grid world problem.\n",

At each position, we have four actions that can be performed next: walk up, walk down, walk left and walk right. If we fall into an ice hole, then the *current* round is over; on the other hand, if we reach the end, we will get one reward point.\n",
